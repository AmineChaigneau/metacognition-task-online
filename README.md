# metacognition-task-online
This repository contains code for running online a metacognition task from: 

Rouault, M., Seow, T., Gillan, C. M., & Fleming, S. M. (2018). Psychiatric symptom dimensions are associated with dissociable shifts in metacognition but not task performance. Biological psychiatry, 84(6), 443-451.

There are three folders containing similar versions of the task in three different languages.

- French

This version corresponds to Experiment 2 of the paper (staircased). Note that the staircase can easily be removed if required.

- SwissGerman

This contains two versions, corresponding to Experiment 1 (not staircased) and Experiment 2 (staircased) from the paper.

- English

This version corresponds to Experiment 2 of the paper (staircased). Note that the staircase can easily be removed if required.
It also includes a folder containing code for running online the battery of questionnaires and IQ test, and a MATLAB script for preprocessing the questionnaire data.


All experiments make use of the following package: jsPsych version 4.3:

De Leeuw, J. R. (2015). jsPsych: A JavaScript library for creating behavioral experiments in a Web browser. Behavior research methods, 47(1), 1-12.


To collect online data from Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific Academic, you will need an online database, such as MySQL.
